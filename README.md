amazonkindleprofile
===================

Working on a script to scrape my amazon kindle profile page and the books and notes there.
Amazon has a public area to store your highlights, notes etc from the kindle books you read.
https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Alfred-E--Nutile/2827195/public_notes

This script will eventually go through all the pages and gather the data to be used in other places.
For starters my website but also some other ideas I have.

I used node.js to start playing around with it.
